# DTM-Tools exome v1.0:Software Description

## Introduction
DTM-Tools was designed for prediction of blood antigen phenotypes from large NGS datasets. It is written in Python and designed to work in a Linux/Unix environment. It can only be run from the command line or through a Docker container – graphical and web interfaces will be implemented in the future.

The description and tutorial material presented in this document is intended as a complement, not a repetition, for the software’s publication. Please refer to ```Citation pending``` before reviewing this material.

## Source Code Structure

[Github main]: https://github.com/DTM-Tools/exome_v1.0

DTM-Tools is written in object-oriented notation as a series of stages (static methods) that create objects, execute, and return the output to the pipeline state. Logging levels are incorporated for future web server deployment.

The source code can be accessed through [Github][Github main]: https://github.com/DTM-Tools/exome_v1.0. Please refer to the DTM-Tools publication for additional details and laboratory validation data.

The following four subdirectories are included in exome v1.0:

_/build_: contains Docker definition files and the Docker deployment entrypoint.

_/databases_: contains three .csv files that define genomic coordinates and their interpretation rules. Described in further detail below.

_/rylantool_: contains DTM-Tools app python scripts

_/queryTools_: contains sample pymongo query scripts

## Dependencies

[pyvcf site]: https://pyvcf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
[freebayes]:https://github.com/ekg/freebayes
[samtools]:http://www.htslib.org/

If run locally, DTM-Tools requires prior installation of [Samtools][samtools], [Freebayes][freebayes], and [pyvcf][pyvcf site]. 

However, a Docker container is available, which obviates the need for these installations and enhances reproducibility of DTM-Tools. Docker command lines can be found in _softwareTutorials.md_ in this /documentation directory.

##Input File Format

* DTM-Tools takes .bam files and the associated index (.bai) file as input; these files should be stored in the directory path specified by the **‘-i’** option. Note that DTM-Tools currently employs Freebayes as its variant caller, which expects the index to have the ‘.bai’ extension, NOT ‘.bam.bai’. This requires renaming of the typical extension given by the samtools index command. Refer to our pre-processing script in this directory for sample commands for alignment and indexing. 

* DTM-Tools also requires the reference genome and its index as input files, stored in the directory path specified by the **‘-r’** command line option. Ensure that this is the exact same reference genome file employed when aligning the raw NGS FASTQ files. Be aware that the hg38 reference genome contains alternative haplotypes and patches which can lead to ambiguous alignments with some software. Note that in our sample preprocessing script we employ the bbmap aligner with the ‘ambiguous=toss’ option, which WILL result in loss of any reads derived from regions with alternative haplotypes (such as the _KEL_ gene). If using this script, limit the reference genome to the chromosomal assemblies only (no patches or haplotypes).

The reference genome version is hg19 by default. Hg38 can be specified with the **‘-g grch38’** option in the DTM-Tools command line. Currently, the expected names of the reference genome fasta files are hard-coded, you can modify them in rylantool/utils.py, getFastaFileName object (lines 19-26, shown below):

	def getFastaFileName(reference):
   	
   		if reference.lower() == "hg19":
        	return 'human_g1k_v37.fasta'
    	elif reference.lower() == "grch38":
        	return 'GRCh38.fasta'
    	else:
        	raise RylanParamException('Invalid reference type: %s' % reference)

DTM-Tools also has the option (**-a**) to report any additional genomic variants in genes of interest. For this purpose, the user is responsible for providing ANNOVAR output files. ANNOVAR output file extensions of ‘Annovar.variant\_function’ and ‘Annovar.exonic\_variant\_function’ are currently expected by the code. If the ANNOVAR output file name is different, you can modify the expected extension in rylantool/additional\_findings\_stage.py, compute\_annovar\_file\_names object (lines 31 and 32, shown below):


	def compute_annovar_file_names(self):
        base_name = self.rylan_params.get_patient_file()[:-10]
        input_dir = self.rylan_params.get_input_directory()
        file2_name = '%s/%s_Annovar.exonic_variant_function'%(input_dir, base_name)
        file1_name = '%s/%s_Annovar.variant_function'%(input_dir, base_name)
        return (file1_name, file2_name)
