# ClinSeq-dbGAP correlation files

## Data sharing statement
Please refer to the DTM-Tools publication for experimental methods and results of the DTM-Tools exome_v1.0 validation with the ClinSeq cohort. 

ClinSeq exome data are available at dbGAP phs000971.v1.p1. We recommend processing fastq data with the sample pre-processing script _TrimAlignSort.sh_, available in the _/Documentation_ directory. To facilitate correlation, this directory provides:

* **_runid_to_dbGaP.csv_** - a comma-delimited file linking dbGAP id for the 108 ClinSamples that underwent serologic validation with their corresponding .json runId.
* **_/jsonClinSeq108_ directory** - contains .json files for the 108 samples that underwent serologic validation. Each file can be identified by the runId. Input file names have been masked for public release.

**DTM-Tools is for research use only and is in continuous development**. Please contact the DTM-Tools developer at <celina.montemayorgarcia@nih.gov> for questions or to request additional data access.
